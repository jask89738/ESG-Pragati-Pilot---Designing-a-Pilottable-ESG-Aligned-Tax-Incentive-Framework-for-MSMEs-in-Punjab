# ESG Pragati Pilot - Designing a Pilottable ESG-Aligned Tax Incentive Framework for MSMEs in Punjab
The core proposal is a framework that links a rebate on the State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) to verifiable ESG benchmarks. Over a 16-week action plan, the project moves from secondary research and stakeholder engagement to co-creating a draft policy, building a simplified "ESG Pragati Toolkit" for MSMEs in English and Punjabi.
Key Deliverables:

Stakeholder Consultation Report: Insights from workshops and surveys with MSMEs, officials, and experts.

Draft Policy Document: "The Punjab MSME ESG-Incentive Framework" ready for testing.

ESG Pragati Toolkit: A digital and printable self-assessment guide for MSMEs.

Pilot Implementation Plan: A roadmap for a real-world pilot with 20-30 MSMEs across 2-3 industrial clusters.

Final Report & Presentation: Compiled for academic submission and advocacy with government departments.
